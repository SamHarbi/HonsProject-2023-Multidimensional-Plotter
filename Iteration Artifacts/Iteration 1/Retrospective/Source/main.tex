\section{Summary}
During the first iteration of the project development. The code base from App Test 2 was taken as a starting point for creating the application. In total, one user story was completed rated at a difficulty of 5. 
\section{Key Points}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This was unsurprisingly a rough start- owning to the fact that this was the first time that PXP was used and generally as an iteration without any previous other to learn from. 
    \item Iteration planning was not accurate- Only 1 user story was completed and a number are currently in progress. Assign less stories per iteration / rework next iteration plan with this in mind
    \item Automated testing for webgl is really difficult to get right, remove it from the development process for now and focus on writing code. 
    \item The do "Simplest thing that works" didn't turn out too well- lot's of factoring overhead had to be added to fix code that although working, had to refactored else any further additions would take exponential amount of time to implement. Allow refactoring tasks to be raised at any point not only when development of a task or story is complete. 
\end{itemize}
