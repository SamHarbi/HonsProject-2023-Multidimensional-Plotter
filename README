# Development Branch

This is the "first stop" for written code. In-Progress code and non-working code is pushed here mainly to keep a backup of the work 
being actively done to complete a task / user story. Once a user story is considered complete- A Pull request is activated to merge the branch with
the Refactor branch for refactoring.
