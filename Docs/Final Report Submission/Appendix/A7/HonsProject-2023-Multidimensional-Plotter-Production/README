This is a copy of the live hosted application. To run it, do the following:

1- Install dependencies with ' npm install '
2- To build a static version that can be hosted, run ' npx parcel build index.html '
3- To run locally as a development server, run ' npx parcel index.html '

The application files can then be found in the dist folder
