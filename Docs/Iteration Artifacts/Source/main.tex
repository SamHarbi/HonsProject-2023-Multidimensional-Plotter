\section{Summary}
During the Second Iteration, development has ramped up and a lot of the most important user stories were made. 
The end of this iteration also coincided with the end of the winter vacation and start of semester 2. In total, 3 user stories + 1 task
was completed with a sum of difficulity score of 16.

\section{Key Points}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This was a much more productive iteration than the last one, although it was slightly longer at 11 days vs the 7 days but it was because the process was finialised that lead to the biggest boost in productivity
    \item Allow extending iteration lengths, This iteration was longer but it allowed a logical atomic conclusion to the work done which otherwise would need to be carried over. 
\end{itemize}
