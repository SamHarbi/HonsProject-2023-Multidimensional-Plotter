\begin{abstract}
  Visualization is a fundamental part of any data analysis project. Yet, market solutions are falling further and further behind in the wake of Big Data pushing the limits of what traditional graphing software can computationally process and effectively communicate to users- Who often need extensive programming experience to use these solutions in the first place. This paper highlights the design and development of a new software application using GPU rendering to address these growing problems of inaccessibility on both fronts- creating an accessible solution that is usable with minimal programming expertise- while still providing the foundations necessary to support further development that can tackle the challenges posed by Big Data.
