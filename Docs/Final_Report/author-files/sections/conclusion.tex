\subsection{Limitations}
This section should outline any limitations that you have identified with your work so far. For example, have you only worked with a limited user demographic? What might be the impact of that? Can you mitigate this as the project progresses or not?


\subsection{Generalisations and Future Work}
This section should outline how you think your project may be used in the future. Consider it being used in different contexts with different user demographics. You may also have already identified some future work that would allow others to expand on your project in the future.
