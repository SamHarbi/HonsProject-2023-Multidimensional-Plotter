\section{The system}
You may want to adjust the title of this section. You should use this section to outline what you intended to create, whether this is a research tool or an application, etc. You should highlight any decisions you have made so far in terms of features. You may wish to include some wireframes or interface designs here if you have them. 

Make sure that you are clear here about what has already been achieved and what has not yet been done. Where you have made assumptions in creating your design, these should be acknowledged.
