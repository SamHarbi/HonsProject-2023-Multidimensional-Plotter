\section{Final Product}
The Application developed is a client-side, web-based plotting application rendering a 3D cube graph showing 10 values on each axis- .CSV data can be uploaded and the user can select which columns to render on which axis's, 3 of which are positional and one modifying the saturation of the plotted point.
Provided user controls include buttons to allow the user to move each axis separately to show a different slice of values, zooming controls to increase or decrease the difference between each line on the whole graph together, rotation through mouse dragging or button clicking, changing data point sizes, modifying how saturation is applied to labels, selecting points on hover to view the values they represent. The application also allows the user to view the data uploaded in a table.
The application can be accessed on any device with different screen sizes including mobile devices as long as OpenGL and a reasonably modern browser is available on that device. Although highly dependant on device specifications, the application can be reasonably expected to render data with 1,000+ Data points. With Modern laptops found to be capabale of rendering at least 40,000 Points with acceptable performance.
