\section{The Plan}
This should outline what you have achieved so far in your project and what you still need to work on. You can present this in any relevant format. 

\subsection{Progress so far}
What are the main things that you have achieved in your project so far? This may include research that you have done, major design and technology options you have explored, requirements gathering tasks, prototyping, testing, user-driven tasks, and so on. What are the main discoveries or stumbling blocks so far? Projects can vary of course in terms of the factors that are relevant to them. Convey what is relevant to your own project.

Be careful not to repeat your earlier background research. This should be written from the point of view of managing your project and not necessarily the specific features that your project will have. 
\subsection{Things still to do}
What will you be doing for the remaining months of your project? Please provide a summary outline of the following, where applicable: technical milestones, evaluation milestones, testing milestones, documentation milestones. You should also consider any major areas of risk that are remaining for your project and briefly describe any plans that you have for mitigating them.
