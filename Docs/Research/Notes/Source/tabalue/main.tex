\emp{ Tableau is a visual analyttics platform that was founded in 2003 with the goal of improving flow of analysis and making data more accessible. To that end, they have a number of products to help drive business desicion making.
Some products of particular interest are Tableau Public, which is a platform to share nicely formatted data charts and a no code creation tool. There's also Tableau desktop which gives a drag and drop interface to
analyze and plot data from a connected data source.

\textbf{Key Points to takeaway from this}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Instead of having a locked data to view pipeline, allow the user to mix and match data fields to plot the data how they wish as in Tableau Desktop. This might be a big addition though since it will be required to essentially create a no code drag and drop system
    \item As an extra have the ability to create nice shareable views that can be downloaded or shared as in Tableau Public.  
    
\end{enumerate}
