\emp{Gnu Plot is a free to use command line program for generating graphs on multiple platforms and as a plotting engine for 
other programs. It has been actively developed since 1986.

\textbf{Key Points to takeaway from this}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Gnu Plot makes use of an editable post script file to modify how the visuals are created. This can be a very useful feature to have which would greatly aid accessibility and create a huge possibilty for user modification. To implement this, it would be needed to design a structure for graphs with interchangable attributes. 
    \item Gnu Plot has a freeware license that allows anyone to modify and freely use the application. An Open Source license for my own project might be something to look into for the far future
