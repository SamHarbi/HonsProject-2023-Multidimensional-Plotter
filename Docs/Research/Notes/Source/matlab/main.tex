\emp{MATLAB is a programming and numeric computing platform which contains the ability to create graphs for data visualisation through built in plots. But, MATLAB truly shines in its
data analytic ability. Allowing the use of multiple different built in functions to be ran on data combined with the MATLAB language itself which is a fully featured programming language built for data analysis.

\textbf{Key Points to takeaway from this}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consider adding functions or otherwise allow the user to analyse thier data and see the result
    \item A very high effort addition could be to integrate a programming language and compiler to allow data to be mutated, Lua might be a good option due to it's small size. prebuilt functions can be made and allowed to be called from Lua.  
    
\end{enumerate}
